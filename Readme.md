## Brief 
  This Progressive Web App (PWA) allows you to calculate all the materials required for tiling. Simply enter the area to be laid, set the appropriate parameters (size of the notched trowel, contact layer, tile and joint sizes) - and you're done!
  You can also calculate the quantities required for levelling surfaces or producing screed.
  The app has an integrated calculator that makes it easy to calculate partial areas and accept the result.
  Dark and light modes are available, and the style of the calculator can also be customised.
  The app supports five different languages:
  - german
  - italian
  - english
  - portuguese
  - romanian


## Features
  * calculating of required tiles, glue and grout
  * calculating of levelling compound or screed

## Screenshots


Required input fields are displayed in red color. The send button is disabled as long as not all required fields are filled out.
You can either input the values for the length and width in the named fields, or by clicking on the area field the input will switch to direct area input.
In this case a calculator icon will be shown on the right side. Now you also have got access to the integrated calculator in order to calculate the area. By clicking the <kbd> â†µ</kbd>  key of the calculator, the value is taken over to the area field.
